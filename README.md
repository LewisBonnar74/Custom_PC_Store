## Python Project


## Build your own PC

You've been tasked with making an app for creating custom PCs. This app gives you the option to create your own PC from scratch, from the list of available components. The PCs themselves will have a name, a list of components and a total price based on those components, meaning each component will need a name and a price.


## MVP

You should be able to create a PC using one of each component from the list of components; GPU, CPU, RAM, Motherboard, PSU. There will be the option to view all created PCs, from where you will be able to edit and/or delete your created PCs. 


## Extensions:

Be able to add your PC to a cart and have a cart total (potentially a checkout/purchase page).

Get a performance mark based on the components you have selected.
